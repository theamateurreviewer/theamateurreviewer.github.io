                            <p>People aren’t born with flawless skin with built in filters from Snapchat or Instagram. In comparison to influencers on YouTube, Tiktok and bloggers, I’m not someone with a twenty-step skincare routine or someone who recommends buying skincare that would break your bank.
Am I like everyone else who will buy a product because it was trending – yes. But I am also that girl who gets overwhelmed by thirty-minute videos on skincare.</p>
<h3 id="was-skincare-always-implemented-in-my-life">Was skincare always implemented in my life?</h3>
<p>No. My skincare journey started with two products:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mango Seed Silk Moisturizing Toner from The Face Shop.</strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://ca.naturecollection.com/en/rice-water-bright-cleansing-foam-150-ml.html">Rice Water Bright Foaming Cleanser</a> from The Face Shop.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When I moved to Canada in 2015, the weather made my skin feel different compared to Bangladesh. It was always drying, and my skin was flaking. The products that I mentioned above are the ones that I used to help my skin recover a little. As a nineteen-year-old, I never thought I would need a skincare routine, but the environment made me change how I treated my skin.</p>

<p>I was and still am a huge fan of Korean dramas, so I liked Korean skincare products. They worked wonders for me too. Face masks from the drugstore would always irritate my skin. There are only specific masks that I can use and there aren’t many options for me.</p>
<p>In 2018, I saw these dark patches developing on my skin. I thought it was just my hormones fluctuating due to my weight. However, I didn’t weigh that much at the time. I assumed it was probably my poor diet or I wasn’t taking care of my skin properly. Since I was a busy college student, living alone, working, and trying to pay rent – free time was not in sight.
I didn’t think of consulting the doctor. In addition to that, since I moved from one city to another, I didn’t have a family doctor in this new city. And Canada has procedures when you want to see a dermatologist. To have an appointment with a specialist, you need to have a family doctor to give you a referral. I didn’t have time for that in my busy schedule, so I tried to find solutions myself.</p>
<p>I was getting desperate, googling everything I could think of. My friend advised me that it was normal for a colored person to have these, and it was most likely hyperpigmentation.</p>
<p>It wasn’t hyperpigmentation. It would make me very uncomfortable to go out with these patches on my chin. To cover up these dark patches, I would use a color corrector to make my skin even tone. I thought people might ask what’s wrong with my skin and I didn’t want to address the situation.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-going-on">What was going on?</h3>
<p>I consulted with my doctor, and she suggested that I should wear sunscreen as I described it as hyperpigmentation on the phone. As a person from a South Asian household, we do not really wear sunscreen unless they were raised in the West. Therefore, I started wearing sunscreen as I waited for my dermatologist appointment, that was set in the following year. The situation was baffling to me because what COVID-19 issue was putting dermatologists to hold up their services like that?</p>
<p>I started using anything that would make my skin glow. I wasn’t aware of what was happening to my skin. As I waited for the dermatologist to see me for over a year, I was playing around with skincare.</p>
<p>Later I found out that I had melasma, which results in dark patches around my chin. My dermatologist gave me a cream mixture to treat it. But I was still playing around with skincare products to see if they would make my skin any better.</p>
<p>The dark patches on my skin didn’t look that bad, but at times it would get worse. My parents don’t live in the same country as me, so they would video call me and see my face. Even they were concerned. I didn’t show much concern whenever I called them. However, because they were concerned, it made me more conscious. I discovered a product called Palmer&rsquo;s Cocoa Butter Formula Eventone Tone Correcting Face Oil. It helped me so much, I was ecstatic.</p>
<p class="pal_cen"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Palmers-Cocoa-Butter-Formula-Correcting/dp/B00KQUXU9C"><img src="/images/palmer_coca.jpg" alt="Palmer’s Cocoa Butter Formula Eventone Tone Correcting Face Oil."></a></p>
<p>I used to shop at the Face Shop, Miniso and Sukoshi Mart for most of my products. However,the FaceShop shut down most of the locations. Due to that, I couldn’t try them on my skin to see if my skin got irritated. This whole situation made me stick to these four products during the lockdown. Miniso and Sukoshi Mart didn’t have an online presence or an e-commerce site to get products delivered which made me unable to buy products that I used previously.</p>
<p>When the pandemic hit, I only used three products:</p>
<ul>
<li>NIVEA Urban Skin Detox Mattifying Peel-off Mask.</li>
<li>Hyaluronic Acid 25 + B5 Hydrating Serum by The Ordinary.</li>
<li>A generic life brand sunscreen from Shopper’s Drug Mart.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="do-you-need-a-thirty-step-skincare-routine-thats-around-seven-hundred-dollars">Do you need a thirty-step skincare routine that’s around seven hundred dollars?</h3>
<p>No. I used three products that were around thirty dollars. They all worked for me, and I feel that people don’t need to have a twenty-step skin care routine to make their skin glow or look better. However, I do feel that everyone’s skincare journey is different, and they need to dip their toes in this obscure pond to know what really works for them.</p>
